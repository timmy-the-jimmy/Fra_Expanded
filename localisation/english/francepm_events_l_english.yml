Blum, being a Jew, has been subject to numerous threats and insults from the right. With the Far Right leagues retaining much influence in France, they have organized antisemitic riots all throughout the nation, some calling for Blum's resignation, and others for his death.

In addition, with the election of the Socialist government, workers, backed by the Parti Communiste Francais have gone on strike, occupying many factories across the nation, hoping to extract concessions from their employers, calling for the Government to back them. We have been invited to Matignon for negotiations in order to resolve the Strikes, but the issue of capital flight may take longer to solve. In the end, one thing is certain.

Of particular notice however, is the tension in the Popular Front regarding the topic. Already, conflict has arisen, with the Radicals aiming to keep France out of the war, while the Communists petition the government to intervene in the conflict to our south. With tensions rising in the Popular Front, we must resolve the issue before it tears the coalition apart."

To achieve this task, a Constitutional Convention to write a new constitution has been formed. The new constitution, while not explicitly socialist in order to assuage moderates, it includes several guarantees of the rights of the working class. Within the Convention, a lively debate has been happening concerning the strength of the presidency. \n\nOn one side lies René Nicod, a new and upcoming socialist politician who leads the Union populaire française, a new and growing political party which has seperated from the larger communist party on issues of foreign policy. While not as popular with the left, he still has many supporters among them as well as much support of those in the center who favor his more moderate views. His proposal would ensure the dominance of the French parliament over the presidency, a quite popular policy among those who fear a communist presidency. \n\nOn the other side lies those more radical individuals led by Maurice Thorez, current Prime Minister and leader of the Communist Party. Well entrenched in political society these days, he has the support among many among the left. His proposal for the presidency would make it much stronger, able to act more independent of parliament, claiming that the recent political turmoil and political gridlock in France would not have happened if the presidency had been stronger. \n\nWhoever wins will gain much political clout in french society and will no doubt end up as the leader of France in the near future, as elections are to be called immediately after the constitution is ratified."

Fighting against our moves at every step, the the leaders of the political opposition, cowards that they are, have been successful in preventing us from enacting the will of the people by colluding with lower level bureaucrats and constantly stalling our political agendas in the parliament. We will suffer their abuses no longer. \n\nMobilizing those most dedicated to the Revolution, we have assembled the Groupes de défense antifascistes to act revolutionary guard to be led by fellow Communist Jacques Duclos in order finally purge the rot from our society. At midnight tonight they are poised to execute their plan to purge France of her class enemies and bring France into a new, more egalitarian age. \n\nThe plan looks set to go ahead, however Duclos has asked for permission to expand the GDA into into a larger Communist paramilitary organization in order to protect the new French Revolution from what he sees as a continent full of reactionaries. There are some concerns that this may give him too much power but he has asssured the party that they have nothing to worry."

Some argue that the Communist Party's role in the coalition gives it leverage to push through women's suffrage but others argue that it would not be worth alienating the other members of the coalition and radicalizing the right.

The other option is an up-and coming military officer by the name of Charles de Gaulle, who has previously stated his wishes for the return of the monarchy under the House of Orléans, and who's military experience would do well in these troubled times. Both options seem like strong leaders, who shall we pick?"
